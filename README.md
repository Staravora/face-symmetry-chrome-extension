This is designed as a quick access tool for face reading using symmetry.

I was inspired to create it by watching ProsopaInsights on YT and thought it would be a fun thing to have for experimentation. It's quite rudimentary and there are some quirks but I've been testing it for a few weeks and I think it is generally pretty acceptable.

I'm not a programmer and this was made using Claude at my direction. So if you think you can make a better tool then please do and let me know.

Installation:
Go to your hamburger menu in your Chrome or Chrome-based browser and click on Extensions > Manage Extensions
Flip on Developer Mode
Click Load Unpacked and direct it to where you cloned the files

Use:
It's designed as an area screenshotter
Click on the tool icon and hit "Activate Tool"
Then click drag on a face and it will make a box and you'll see two red lines on top and bottom which you can determine the centerline with
You can also adjust those lines however it is likely to skew the face. In fact recommend you try to make the box as symmetrical as possible for best results

Once you've got it, you can alternate between right and left sides and it is labeled as the person's left and right
Then you can download the images if you want



Additional note:
I made it for faces but I spose you can use it for other mirroring too
Does tend to make some funny results
